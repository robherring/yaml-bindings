title: /chosen Node

maintainers:
  - Devicetree Specification Mailing List <devicetree-spec@vger.kernel.org>

description:
  The chosen node does not represent a real device, but serves as a place
  for passing data between firmware and the operating system, like boot
  arguments. Data in the chosen node does not represent the hardware.

properties:
  $nodename:
    const: chosen

  "#address-cells": true
  "#size-cells": true
  ranges: true

  bootargs:
    $ref: types.yaml#definitions/string

  kaslr-seed:
    $ref: types.yaml#definitions/uint64
    description:
      This property is used when booting with CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE as the
      entropy used to randomize the kernel image base address location. Since
      it is used directly, this value is intended only for KASLR, and should
      not be used for other purposes (as it may leak information about KASLR
      offsets). It is parsed as a u64 value, e.g.

      /{
              chosen {
                      kaslr-seed = <0xfeedbeef 0xc0def00d>;
              };
      };

      Note that if this property is set from UEFI (or a bootloader in EFI
      mode) when EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL is supported, it will be overwritten by
      the Linux EFI stub (which will populate the property itself, using
      EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL).

  rng-seed:
    $ref: types.yaml#definitions/uint8-array
    description:
      This property served as an entropy to add device randomness. It is parsed
      as a byte array, e.g.

      /{
             chosen {
                     rng-seed = /bits/ 8 <0x31 0x95 0x1b 0x3c 0xc9 0xfa ...>;
             };
      };

      This random value should be provided by bootloader.

  linux,booted-from-kexec:
    type: boolean
    description:
      This property is set (currently only on PowerPC, and only needed on
      book3e) by some versions of kexec-tools to tell the new kernel that it
      is being booted by kexec, as the booting environment may differ (e.g.
      a different secondary CPU release mechanism).

  linux,elfcorehdr:
    allOf:
      - $ref: types.yaml#definitions/uint64-array
      - maxItems: 2
    description:
      This property (currently used only on arm64) holds the memory range,
      the address and the size, of the elf core header which mainly describes
      the panicked kernel\'s memory layout as PT_LOAD segments of elf format.

  linux,usable-memory-range:
    allOf:
      - $ref: types.yaml#definitions/uint64-array
      - items:
          maxItems: 2
    description: |
      This property (arm64 only) holds base address and size of memory regions,
      describing limited regions in which memory may be considered available
      for use by the kernel. Memory outside of these ranges is not available
      for use.

      This property describes a limitation: memory within these ranges are only
      valid when also described through another mechanism that the kernel
      would otherwise use to determine available memory (e.g. memory nodes
      or the EFI memory map). Valid memory may be sparse within the range.

      / {
              chosen {
                      linux,usable-memory-range = <0x9 0xf0000000 0x0 0x10000000>;
              };
      };

      The main usage is for crash dump kernel to identify its own usable
      memory and exclude, at its boot time, any other memory areas that are
      part of the panicked kernel\'s memory.

      While this property does not represent a real hardware, the address
      and the size are expressed in #address-cells and #size-cells,
      respectively, of the root node.

  linux,initrd-start:
    $ref: types.yaml#definitions/uint32
    description:
      These properties hold the physical start and end address of an initrd that\'s
      loaded by the bootloader. Note that linux,initrd-start is inclusive, but
      linux,initrd-end is exclusive.

  linux,initrd-end:
    $ref: types.yaml#definitions/uint32
    description:
      These properties hold the physical start and end address of an initrd that\'s
      loaded by the bootloader. Note that linux,initrd-start is inclusive, but
      linux,initrd-end is exclusive.

  linux,pci-probe-only:
    allOf:
      - $ref: types.yaml#definitions/uint32
    enum: [ 0, 1 ]
    description:
      Optional property which takes a single-cell argument. If '0', then Linux
      will assign devices in its usual manner, otherwise it will not try to
      assign devices and instead use them as they are configured already.

  stdout-path:
    allOf:
      - $ref: types.yaml#definitions/string
      - pattern: "^[a-zA-Z0-9@/,+\\-._]*(:[0-9]*[noe]?[78]?[r]?)?$"
    description: |
      Device trees may specify the device to be used for boot console output
      with a stdout-path property under /chosen, as described in the Devicetree
      Specification, e.g.

      / {
        chosen {
                stdout-path = "/serial@f00:115200";
        };

        serial@f00 {
                compatible = "vendor,some-uart";
                reg = <0xf00 0x10>;
        };
      };

      If the character ":" is present in the value, this terminates the path.
      The meaning of any characters following the ":" is device-specific, and
      must be specified in the relevant binding documentation.

      For UART devices, the preferred binding is a string in the form:

        <baud>{<parity>{<bits>{<flow>}}}

      where

        baud    - baud rate in decimal
        parity  - 'n' (none), 'o', (odd) or 'e' (even)
        bits    - number of data bits
        flow    - 'r' (rts)

      For example: 115200n8r

      Implementation note: Linux will look for the property "linux,stdout-path"
      or on PowerPC "stdout" if "stdout-path" is not found.  However, the
      "linux,stdout-path" and "stdout" properties are deprecated. New platforms
      should only use the "stdout-path" property.
